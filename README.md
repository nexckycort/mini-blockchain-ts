# Mini Blockchain TypeScript

An educational implementation of a blockchain in TypeScript to understand the fundamental concepts of this technology.

## What is this project?

This project is a simplified blockchain that demonstrates the core concepts of:

* **Chained blocks** with cryptographic hashes
* **Digitally signed transactions** using elliptic-curve cryptography
* **Integrity validation** with Merkle trees
* **Wallets** for managing public/private keys
* **Basic consensus** via signature validation

## Features

âœ… **Blockchain Core**

* Automatic creation of the genesis block
* Secure chaining using SHA-256 hashes
* Full chain validation

âœ… **Transaction System**

* Digital signatures with secp256k1
* Automatic transaction validation
* Prevention of post-signature tampering

âœ… **Cryptographic Wallets**

* Secure generation of private/public keys
* Transaction signing and verification
* Compatibility with cryptographic standards

âœ… **Merkle Tree**

* Per-block transaction integrity
* Efficient verification without downloading the entire block

ðŸš§ **P2P Network** (Work in progress)

* Node-to-node communication
* Blockchain synchronization
